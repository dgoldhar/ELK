# Using the empowclassifier plugin

## Example

A log may look like this before the classification (in json representation, probably not ideal to show on the logstash manuals):
 
```
{
	"product_type": "IDS",
	"product_name": "snort",
	" threat": { "signature": "1:234" }
}
```
 
After filtering, using the plugin, the response would be contain these fields:
 
```
{
    "signatureTactics": [
        {
            "tactic": "Full compromise - active patterns",
            "attackStage": "Infiltration",
            "isSrcPerformer": true
        }
    ]
}
```
 

```signatureTactics``` is an array of the tactics classified by empow.

each result contains the actual tactic,

the attack stage empow classified for this log (determined by the tactic and whether the source and dest are within the user's network),

and whether the source was the performer or the victim of this attack.
